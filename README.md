### Reporting map bugs, suggesting map changes

* Find the map repository hosting the map in question: https://github.com/triplea-maps
  * replace spaces with "_" and remember map repository names will be all lower case
* Once at the repository page, say for example: "https://github.com/triplea-maps/world_at_war", look for the "issues" link and click new. Alternatively, if you know the repostory url, the new issue URL is pretty easy to type in manually: https://github.com/triplea-maps/world_at_war/issues/new
* When reporting an issue, a key is to be as specific and as consice as possible. For example, state explicity which actions you wish to be taken to resolve the issue, and also specifically what must be done for the issue to be considered resolved.
* It is easier to handle many sharply focused issues than it is to handle one that deals with every issue out there. For very broad topics, consider using the Project issue queue: https://github.com/triplea-maps/Project/issues/new, or the source forge forums: http://triplea.sourceforge.net/mywiki/Forum
