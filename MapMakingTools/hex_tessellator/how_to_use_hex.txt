Ok, I made this hex tessellation pattern for use on hex based games

to use it, simply set it as a "pattern" in gimp or photoshop or whatever u use
(select all, copy, paste as -> new pattern)

then switch to the paintbucket, and switch to painting patterns, then click


you automatically fill the entire map up with hexes

yay


i made this hex specifically to fit 6 full sized units, which i consider about right for triplea 

thx,
