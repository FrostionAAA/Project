#!/bin/bash


## Script Usage and OVerview:
##   Running this script will standardize the name of every folder in your current folder.
##   Intent is to run this when adding or migrating a map repository so all map repositories 
##   have a standard name.


## Script Technical Notes:
## - set -e, flag tells bash to halt if any errors are encountered
## - Use a while loop construct to handle cases where a folder name may have a space in it.
##   A for loop would break up the name across the space, while loop keeps it together.
## - The NEW_NAME mutation uppercases the first letter and each first letter after a space
##   or underscore. It then finishes by replaces spaces with underscores.
## - The find command sent into the "done" of the while loop lists current folder names,
##   and does some 'sed' work to clean up the folder names.

set -e

while read -r folderName; do
  NEW_NAME=$(echo "$folderName" | sed -e "s/_\(.\)/_\u\1/g" | sed -e "s/\b\(.\)/\u\1/g" | sed "s/ /_/g")
  if [ ! "$folderName" == "$NEW_NAME" ]; then
    mv -v "$folderName/" $NEW_NAME/
  fi
done < <(find . -maxdepth 1 -type d | grep -v "^.$" | sed "s|^./||g")
